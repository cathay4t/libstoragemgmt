[StorageSystem]
    * How to get top-level StorageSystem?
        EnumerateInstances('SSM_StorageSystem') with ParentSystems=="NULL".

    * How to query system name like vendor, module/product name?
        TODO
        ProvenanceInfo should do.

    * How to query and compare system firmware version?

    * How to query system status and find out what went wrong?


[StoragePool]
    * What does 'Basic' of SSM_StoragePool['PoolType'] mean?
        In SSM r25, it seems indicate a disk or disk partition.
        while 'Aggregated' means disk RAID pool.
        In your case, your storage might be 'Aggregated' type.

    * Any standard way to tell SSM_StoragePool is one of these type?
        a) RAID group from disks.
        b) RAID group from disk partition.
        c) Aggregate of two or more other pools.
        d) Allocation from other pool.

        If there is not, I would propose to extend 'PoolType' to
        'Disk RAID Group', 'Disk slice RAID Group',
        'Aggregated Pool', 'Pool slice'.

    * Any standard way to query pool membership?
        If not, I would suggest to extend 'MemberInstanceID' to hold:
            a) SSM_PhysicalDisk[1] InstanceID.
            b) SSM_PhysicalDiskSlice InstanceID.
            c) SSM_StoragePool InstanceID.
            d) SSM_StoragePoolSlice InstanceID.

    * What's the RAID type of certain pool?
        How about SSM_StoragePool['RAIDType']:
            JBOD, RAID0, RAID1, RAID1DP, etc

    * What type of element could current pool create? 
        How about list with any combination of 
            * Volume
            * Snapshot
            * Pool      
                # Indicate this pool could be use to assemble
                # aggregated pool
            * PoolSlice
                # Indicate this pool allocate small pool.
